## Background

Android does not support CTAP2 over NFC. The built-in WebAuthn implementation only handles basic U2F-style authentication for NFC keys, which means no PIN verification and no discoverable credentials (passkeys). USB-C keys have better support, but NFC keys are limited to tap-to-authenticate without user verification.

Authnkey implements the CTAP2 protocol directly, allowing full passkey functionality with NFC security keys like YubiKey or SoloKey.

Additionally, Android's FIDO2 support depends on Google Play Services. Authnkey works on devices without GApps since it implements the protocol independently.

## Features

- Passkey creation and authentication over NFC and USB
- PIN verification (CTAP2 clientPin)
- Discoverable credentials
- Multiple account selection
- No Google Play Services required

## Requirements

- Android 14+ (API 34)
- A FIDO2-compatible security key

## Usage

1. Install the app
2. Enable Authnkey in Settings → Passwords & accounts → Passwords, passkeys, and data services
3. When a site or app requests a passkey, select "Security Key" from the credential provider options
